# QIK-VRT

QIK-VRT is a research implementation of an **effect haltpoint**: successful
transport, computation, or storage does not by itself authorize an ordinary
downstream effect. A bounded decision gate records provenance, context, risk,
responsibility, evidence, and a connection decision before release.

The reference protocol has exactly five normative states:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `EFFECT_NACK` | No effect-checkable reception exists. |
| `EFFECT_ACK_CONTINUE` | Checking may continue; the effect is not released. |
| `EFFECT_ACK_DONE` | All declared release conditions are satisfied. This is the only ordinary-release state. |
| `EFFECT_ACK_ISOLATE` | Separate the candidate effect from ordinary flow for controlled examination. |
| `EFFECT_ACK_BLOCK` | Do not continue the candidate effect. |

The core invariant is:

```text
TRANSPORT_ACK != EFFECT_ACK
ordinary_release(result) == (result.effect_state == EFFECT_ACK_DONE)
```

## Scope of the claim

This repository defines, implements, and tests a policy/effect release
haltpoint for a specific bounded decision. It **does not solve Turing's
halting problem** and does not predict whether an arbitrary program will
terminate. Program termination, exit code `0`, message delivery, and a local
test PASS are not effect permission.

The software demonstrates a concrete reference protocol and selected local
adapters. It is not a certification of every historical file in the
repository, a scientific validation of every accompanying theory, or evidence
of external adoption. See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for the precise verification
boundary.

The complete German-language synthesis, including the ontology of difference,
the effect haltpoint, evidence boundaries, the personal starting chronology,
and the interdisciplinary argument, is published as
[Die Spirale des entscheidenden Unterschieds](docs/Die_Spirale_des_entscheidenden_Unterschieds.md).

## Current runnable core

- `src/qikvrt_effect_ack.py` — pure five-state reference state machine,
  canonical JSON, deterministic protocol hashes, deadlines, immutable
  versions, and hash-linked responsibility records.
- `src/qikvrt_api_handler.py` — content-addressed ingest, verify, stage, and
  HMAC-authenticated release-status paths with replay protection, transaction recovery,
  provenance records, receipts, and an append-only audit hash chain.
- `src/qikvrt_github_api_shim.py` — authenticated, repository-scoped local
  GitHub-shaped HTTP adapter.
- `scripts/qikvrt_api_client.py` — validating client; cleartext bearer tokens
  are permitted only on loopback endpoints.
- `qikvrt.py` — authorization-before-effect launcher for the master gate and the
  explicitly confirmed publication planner.
- `tools/qikvrt_subprocess.py` — subprocess runner with hard time and captured-
  output bounds plus descendant process-group termination on POSIX.
- `tools/qikvrt_integrity.py` — HEAD-independent content-tree manifest and
  detached digest generation/verification with a crash-recoverable held lock.
- `.github/workflows/` — least-privilege CI and state-artifact workflows with
  immutable third-party action pins. A restored API-state artifact is accepted
  only after its producing run is bound through GitHub's authenticated API to
  the same repository, workflow, commit, permitted event, and successful end.

The active Python core uses only the standard library. The verified local
runtime target is Python 3 on POSIX systems. Some lock and durability behavior
uses POSIX facilities; Windows compatibility is **not claimed** for the
current core. Historical Windows/Zenodo material remains in the repository as
an archive and is not the current runtime authority.

## Verify

Run the complete local gate:

```bash
make test
```

The gate compiles the active Python entry points and runs integrity, launcher,
protocol-conformance, handler, security, client, and TCP/IP end-to-end tests.
It verifies the canonical repository manifest before and after the tests.

To regenerate the canonical content-tree manifest after an intentional
change, then verify it:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -B tools/qikvrt_integrity.py generate
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -B tools/qikvrt_integrity.py verify
```

The current integrity authorities are:

- `REPOSITORY_FILE_MANIFEST.json`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- `REPOSITORY_FILE_MANIFEST.json.sha256`

Older inventories are historical snapshots; see
[LEGACY_INTEGRITY_INVENTORIES.md](LEGACY_INTEGRITY_INVENTORIES.md).
Historical files whose original payload is not present, and earlier reports
whose claims have been superseded, are classified in
[HISTORICAL_ARTIFACT_BOUNDARIES.md](HISTORICAL_ARTIFACT_BOUNDARIES.md).

## Launcher

The launcher deliberately refuses effectful work until a local operator has
authorized the exact, repository-bound command scope. This declaration is not
identity authentication and is not acceptance of, or an extra condition on,
the repository licenses:

```bash
python3 qikvrt.py --accept
python3 qikvrt.py master-gate
```

Publication is a separate planner with an additional explicit confirmation.
It does not silently commit or push:

```bash
python3 qikvrt.py cicd-publish
```

Inspect its result and provide the requested confirmation only when the exact
repository, branch, changes, and destination are intended.
An executing publication plan writes a durable local effect journal through
`PREPARED`, `APPLIED`, `VERIFIED`, and `COMMITTED`; a verification failure
after a remote command is recorded as an unknown external state rather than
misreported as a rollback.

## Local API

Start the adapter only with an explicit scoped credential and repository:

```bash
export QIKVRT_API_TOKEN="b64url:$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"
export QIKVRT_API_TOKEN_EXPIRES_UTC='2099-01-01T00:00:00Z'
export QIKVRT_ALLOWED_REPOSITORY='owner/repository'
export QIKVRT_API_PRINCIPAL='responsible-operator'
make run-api
```

API tokens use exactly `b64url:<unpadded-value>` and must decode to 32--128
bytes. When remote release attestations are enabled,
`QIKVRT_REMOTE_ATTESTATION_SECRET` uses the same encoding and size rule and
must be paired with `QIKVRT_TRUSTED_ATTESTATION_SIGNER`. The decoded bytes,
not the encoded environment string, are the HMAC key. Generate the HMAC key
independently from the bearer token; never reuse one secret for both roles.
The adapter rejects configurations that reuse identical decoded bytes for the
two roles.

The default listener is loopback. Do not expose the development adapter as an
internet service. A non-loopback deployment needs TLS termination, secret
management, host hardening, monitoring, and a separately reviewed trust
boundary. The request and response contract is documented in
[`api/qikvrt_github_api.openapi.yaml`](api/qikvrt_github_api.openapi.yaml).

Non-dry mutations require all of the following: an authenticated and unexpired
credential, the allowed owner/repository route, a stable request identifier,
an explicit `effect_accepted=true` decision, and a server-derived responsible
owner. Release status reaches `EFFECT_ACK_DONE` only after verification of a
trusted, HMAC-authenticated remote attestation bound to the repository,
artifact, size, immutable source identifier, and hash. HMAC is a keyed
message-authentication mechanism, not a public-key digital signature; its
trust therefore depends on protecting and independently governing the shared
verification secret.

`GET /health` returns `ALIVE` only while the scoped credential, expiry,
repository, principal, numeric limits, and any configured remote-attestation
key pair all pass validation. An invalid configuration returns HTTP 503 and
`BLOCK`.

## Security and evidence boundaries

- Payload size, identifiers, metadata, JSON bodies, and synchronous decision
  time are bounded.
- Symlink targets and unsafe paths are rejected; artifact names are validated.
- Same-key/different-fact replay conflicts are isolated.
- Audit, protocol, provenance, receipt, and stage records are append-only or
  content-addressed within the local trust boundary.
- Ingest provenance is cross-bound to the request, receipt, transaction,
  result hash, exact effect set, responsibility protocol, repository, and
  responsible owner before staging.
- Runtime commands use unique per-run logs and a latest-run pointer; captured
  child-process output remains bounded and byte-safe in JSONL.
- Authorization context, records, actor/scope values and prior logs are bounded
  and symlink-safe; repeated operation scopes fail closed instead of widening
  authority. Arbitrary child-process bytes remain valid JSONL log data.
- Publication assets are bound in the plan by repository path, byte count and
  SHA-256, must be tracked and byte-identical to `HEAD` immediately before the
  effect, and must match GitHub's reported remote SHA-256 and size afterward.
- A local hash chain detects later changes only when at least one trusted hash
  or signature is retained outside the writable chain.
- Remote GitHub workflow execution and external platform persistence are not
  proven by a local test run.
- Legal, medical, psychological, physical, ethical, or historical conclusions
  require their own evidence and qualified review; software structure does
  not make an input claim true.

## Repository organization

The repository contains both the current runtime and a large historical
research/delivery archive. Current operational authority is intentionally
narrow: the files named above, the active tests, the canonical integrity
manifest, the OpenAPI contract, and the current status. Cumulative delivery,
acceptance, or audit reports from earlier versions are retained for provenance
but must not be read as current certification unless [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)
expressly names them.

## Licensing

Current QIK-VRT-controlled source code and executable tooling are offered under
`PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0` unless a more specific file or third-party
notice applies. The standard public license permits its defined noncommercial
uses; ordinary commercial use requires a separate written license from the
rights holder. This makes the current code source-available, not OSI-approved
open source.

Documentation and other non-source material are offered under Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International unless a file says
otherwise. Earlier versions or files validly received under Apache-2.0 retain
that historical grant; the transition cannot withdraw it retroactively.

The licenses do not merge and grant no rights the licensor does not hold. See
