![QIK-VRT — five-state auditable effect release](docs/assets/qikvrt-social-preview.png)

**`TRANSPORT_ACK != EFFECT_ACK` — technical success is not yet accountable
effect release.**

QIK-VRT is a research implementation of an **effect haltpoint**: successful
transport, computation, or storage does not by itself authorize an ordinary
downstream effect. A bounded decision gate records provenance, context, risk,
responsibility, evidence, and a connection decision before release.

The reference protocol has exactly five normative states:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `EFFECT_NACK` | No effect-checkable reception exists. |
| `EFFECT_ACK_CONTINUE` | Checking may continue; the effect is not released. |
| `EFFECT_ACK_DONE` | All declared release conditions are satisfied. This is the only ordinary-release state. |
| `EFFECT_ACK_ISOLATE` | Separate the candidate effect from ordinary flow for controlled examination. |
| `EFFECT_ACK_BLOCK` | Do not continue the candidate effect. |

The core invariant is:

```text
TRANSPORT_ACK != EFFECT_ACK
ordinary_release(result) == (result.state == EFFECT_ACK_DONE)
```

## One-minute evaluator path

```bash
python3 examples/effect_haltpoint_demo.py
make test
```

The demonstration uses no network, credential, or external service. It shows
open checks, controlled isolation, responsible blocking, and a fully bound
`DONE`; only the final result has `ordinary_release=true`.

## Scope of the claim

This repository defines, implements, and tests a policy/effect release
haltpoint for a specific bounded decision. It **does not solve Turing's
halting problem** and does not predict whether an arbitrary program will
terminate. Program termination, exit code `0`, message delivery, and a local
test PASS are not effect permission.

The software demonstrates a concrete reference protocol and selected local
adapters. It is not a certification of every historical file in the
repository, a scientific validation of every accompanying theory, or evidence
of external adoption. See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for the precise verification
boundary.

The complete German-language synthesis, including the ontology of difference,
the effect haltpoint, evidence boundaries, the personal starting chronology,
and the interdisciplinary argument, is published as
[Die Spirale des entscheidenden Unterschieds](docs/Die_Spirale_des_entscheidenden_Unterschieds.md).

The 62-page scientific Version 3.0 on the Mandelbrot set, recursive connection
order, dimensional physical correspondence, and retrocausality is available as
a [verifiable publication bundle](docs/publications/2026-07-21-mandelbrot-retrocausality/README.md)
with the [rendered PDF](docs/publications/2026-07-21-mandelbrot-retrocausality/Mandelbrot_Anschlussordnung_Physik_Retrokausalitaet_V3_2026-07-21.pdf),
LaTeX source, bibliography, and SHA-256 checksums.

The formal decidable core is now also available as a
[machine-verifiable Lean/TypeScript/Python package](formalization/QIKVRT_Formalization_v1.0/README.md),
archived at [Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.21488116](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21488116).
The [public-language article and exact evidence boundary](docs/publications/2026-07-22-machine-verifiable-proof-status/README.md)
state separately what is proved, conditionally proved, empirically open,
interpretive, or normative. A reproducible local-only
[audio-transcription tool](tools/offline-audio-transcription/README.md) keeps
speech recognition, human correction, interpretation, and publication as
distinct steps.

The further [EFFECT_ACK universality working-paper bundle](docs/publications/2026-07-22-effect-ack-universal-effect-control/README.md)
separates three claims that must not be conflated: a universalizable control
process for finite accessible digital artifacts, semantic reconstruction under
the exact observation-fibre criterion, and exact historical inversion only
under injective observation. Its executable finite model checks 2,621,440
state assignments and 5,242,880 consumer-admission variants. Cyberphysical
transfer remains conditional on complete mediation, fresh authenticated
consumer validation, a faithful executor, a disclosed physical model, and
empirical validation; the result is not a universal decoder or unconditional
safety proof.

## Current runnable core

- `src/qikvrt_effect_ack.py` — pure five-state reference state machine,
  canonical JSON, deterministic protocol hashes, deadlines, immutable
  versions, and hash-linked responsibility records.
- `src/qikvrt_api_handler.py` — content-addressed ingest, verify, stage, and
  HMAC-authenticated release-status paths with replay protection, transaction recovery,
  provenance records, receipts, and an append-only audit hash chain.
- `src/qikvrt_github_api_shim.py` — authenticated, repository-scoped local
  GitHub-shaped HTTP adapter.
- `scripts/qikvrt_api_client.py` — validating client; cleartext bearer tokens
  are permitted only on loopback endpoints.
- `qikvrt.py` — authorization-before-effect launcher for the master gate and the
  explicitly confirmed publication planner.
- `tools/qikvrt_subprocess.py` — subprocess runner with hard time and captured-
  output bounds plus descendant process-group termination on POSIX.
- `tools/qikvrt_integrity.py` — HEAD-independent content-tree manifest and
  detached digest generation/verification with a crash-recoverable held lock.
- `.github/workflows/` — least-privilege CI and state-artifact workflows with
  immutable third-party action pins. A restored API-state artifact is accepted
  only after its producing run is bound through GitHub's authenticated API to
  the same repository, workflow, commit, permitted event, and successful end.
- `include/qikvrt/effect_ack.h` and `src/effect_ack_core.c` — dependency-free
  ANSI-C90 decision core for the exact five-state, 17-conjunct Draft-01
  abstraction; the exhaustive C oracle covers all 2,621,440 valid snapshots.
- `runtime/toolchains/` and `tools/bootstrap-*` — versioned runtime contracts,
  third-party provenance and checksum-gated bootstraps. Runtime binaries and
  credentials are deliberately excluded from Git and remain rebuildable cache
  content.
- `AGENTS.md`, `docs/COLLECTIVE_ADAPTIVE_COGNITION.md`, and
  `policy/COLLECTIVE_ADAPTIVE_COGNITION.json` — the bounded collective
  improvement protocol: exact-key caches automatically accelerate later
  environment construction, while measurements create attributable proposals
  for separate review. They never suppress tests, mutate protected semantics,
  reorder work without a reviewed implementation, merge, tag, release, publish,
  or declare `EFFECT_ACK_DONE` autonomously.

The active Python core uses only the standard library; the additional decision
core is strict ANSI C90. The verified local integration target remains Python
3 on POSIX systems. The checksum-gated GitHub-CLI bootstrap and its failure
controls execute on Linux, macOS, and Windows. The canonical `xml2rfc` renderer
remains CPython 3.12.13: Linux exercises it end to end, while macOS and Windows
remain fail closed and automatically activate the same gate when that exact
patch release becomes available in their hosted toolcaches. A fallback Python
may run syntax checks but is never represented as the canonical renderer.
General cross-platform certification is not claimed.

## Verify

Run the complete local gate:

```bash
make test
```

Run the short state-transition demonstration separately:

```bash
python3 examples/effect_haltpoint_demo.py
```

The gate compiles the active Python entry points and runs integrity, launcher,
protocol-conformance, handler, security, client, and TCP/IP end-to-end tests.
It verifies the canonical repository manifest before and after the tests.

To regenerate the canonical content-tree manifest after an intentional
change, then verify it:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -B tools/qikvrt_integrity.py generate
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -B tools/qikvrt_integrity.py verify
```

The current integrity authorities are:

- `REPOSITORY_FILE_MANIFEST.json`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- `REPOSITORY_FILE_MANIFEST.json.sha256`

Older inventories are historical snapshots; see
[LEGACY_INTEGRITY_INVENTORIES.md](LEGACY_INTEGRITY_INVENTORIES.md).
Historical files whose original payload is not present, and earlier reports
whose claims have been superseded, are classified in
[HISTORICAL_ARTIFACT_BOUNDARIES.md](HISTORICAL_ARTIFACT_BOUNDARIES.md).

## Launcher

The launcher deliberately refuses effectful work until a local operator has
authorized the exact, repository-bound command scope. This declaration is not
identity authentication and is not acceptance of, or an extra condition on,
the repository licenses:

```bash
python3 qikvrt.py --accept
python3 qikvrt.py master-gate
```

Publication is a separate planner with an additional explicit confirmation.
It does not silently commit or push:

```bash
python3 qikvrt.py cicd-publish
```

Inspect its result and provide the requested confirmation only when the exact
repository, branch, changes, and destination are intended.
An executing publication plan writes a durable local effect journal through
`PREPARED`, `APPLIED`, `VERIFIED`, and `COMMITTED`; a verification failure
after a remote command is recorded as an unknown external state rather than
misreported as a rollback.

## Local API

Start the adapter only with an explicit scoped credential and repository:

```bash
export QIKVRT_API_TOKEN="b64url:$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"
export QIKVRT_API_TOKEN_EXPIRES_UTC='2099-01-01T00:00:00Z'
export QIKVRT_ALLOWED_REPOSITORY='owner/repository'
export QIKVRT_API_PRINCIPAL='responsible-operator'
make run-api
```

API tokens use exactly `b64url:<unpadded-value>` and must decode to 32--128
bytes. When remote release attestations are enabled,
`QIKVRT_REMOTE_ATTESTATION_SECRET` uses the same encoding and size rule and
must be paired with `QIKVRT_TRUSTED_ATTESTATION_SIGNER`. The decoded bytes,
not the encoded environment string, are the HMAC key. Generate the HMAC key
independently from the bearer token; never reuse one secret for both roles.
The adapter rejects configurations that reuse identical decoded bytes for the
two roles.

The default listener is loopback. Do not expose the development adapter as an
internet service. A non-loopback deployment needs TLS termination, secret
management, host hardening, monitoring, and a separately reviewed trust
boundary. The request and response contract is documented in
[`api/qikvrt_github_api.openapi.yaml`](api/qikvrt_github_api.openapi.yaml).

Non-dry mutations require all of the following: an authenticated and unexpired
credential, the allowed owner/repository route, a stable request identifier,
an explicit `effect_accepted=true` decision, and a server-derived responsible
owner. Release status reaches `EFFECT_ACK_DONE` only after verification of a
trusted, HMAC-authenticated remote attestation bound to the repository,
artifact, size, immutable source identifier, and hash. HMAC is a keyed
message-authentication mechanism, not a public-key digital signature; its
trust therefore depends on protecting and independently governing the shared
verification secret.

`GET /health` returns `ALIVE` only while the scoped credential, expiry,
repository, principal, numeric limits, and any configured remote-attestation
key pair all pass validation. An invalid configuration returns HTTP 503 and
`BLOCK`.

## Security and evidence boundaries

- Payload size, identifiers, metadata, JSON bodies, and synchronous decision
  time are bounded.
- Symlink targets and unsafe paths are rejected; artifact names are validated.
- Same-key/different-fact replay conflicts are isolated.
- Audit, protocol, provenance, receipt, and stage records are append-only or
  content-addressed within the local trust boundary.
- Ingest provenance is cross-bound to the request, receipt, transaction,
  result hash, exact effect set, responsibility protocol, repository, and
  responsible owner before staging.
- Runtime commands use unique per-run logs and a latest-run pointer; captured
  child-process output remains bounded and byte-safe in JSONL.
- Authorization context, records, actor/scope values and prior logs are bounded
  and symlink-safe; repeated operation scopes fail closed instead of widening
  authority. Arbitrary child-process bytes remain valid JSONL log data.
- Publication assets are bound in the plan by repository path, byte count and
  SHA-256, must be tracked and byte-identical to `HEAD` immediately before the
  effect, and must match GitHub's reported remote SHA-256 and size afterward.
- A local hash chain detects later changes only when at least one trusted hash
  or signature is retained outside the writable chain.
- Remote GitHub workflow execution and Pages publication for the fixed release
  are independently evidenced by the hosted run links above. A local test run
  alone would not prove those external effects, and no claim is made for every
  possible remote integration.
- Legal, medical, psychological, physical, ethical, or historical conclusions
  require their own evidence and qualified review; software structure does
  not make an input claim true.

## Repository organization

The repository contains both the current runtime and a large historical
research/delivery archive. Current operational authority is intentionally
narrow: the files named above, the active tests, the canonical integrity
manifest, the OpenAPI contract, and the current status. Cumulative delivery,
acceptance, or audit reports from earlier versions are retained for provenance
but must not be read as current certification unless [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)
expressly names them. See [docs/CURRENT_AUTHORITY.md](docs/CURRENT_AUTHORITY.md)
for a compact map.

## Licensing

Current QIK-VRT-controlled source code and executable tooling are offered under
`PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0` unless a more specific file or third-party
notice applies. The standard public license permits its defined noncommercial
uses; ordinary commercial use requires a separate written license from the
rights holder. This makes the current code source-available, not OSI-approved
open source.

Documentation and other non-source material are offered under Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International unless a file says
otherwise. Earlier versions or files validly received under Apache-2.0 retain
that historical grant; the transition cannot withdraw it retroactively.

The licenses do not merge and grant no rights the licensor does not hold. See
