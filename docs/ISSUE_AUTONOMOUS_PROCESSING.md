# Autonomous issue processing contract

## Effect

Every newly opened, reopened, or edited non-pull-request issue triggers the repository-native issue processor. Existing issues can be processed through `workflow_dispatch` with their issue number.

The processor:

1. fetches the authoritative GitHub issue payload;
2. materializes a canonical request and SHA-256 evidence;
3. gathers deterministic, size-bounded repository context;
4. compiles a repository-grounded disposition using reviewed local code;
5. emits truthful status metadata;
6. validates the evidence bundle and no-false-pass rules;
7. creates or updates `issue-agent/<number>`;
8. opens a reviewable pull request;
9. comments the status and PR URL on the issue.

## Non-negotiable gates

- No automatic merge.
- No automatic issue closure.
- Compiler failure or an unsupported work-unit class produces `BLOCK`, not a fabricated answer.
- Generated work remains `CONTINUE` until repository checks and human review establish a stronger state.
- The issue payload and its digest remain part of the committed evidence.
- Formal derivation, repository evidence, hypothesis, and empirical confirmation must remain distinguishable.

## Authentication and compilation

The workflow uses GitHub's ephemeral `GITHUB_TOKEN` only for repository-local
contents, issues, and pull requests. It grants no model permission and performs
no external-model call. `scripts/issue_agent/compile.py` is fail-closed: only
schema-validated handlers added through reviewed repository changes may become
executable work units. The initial compiler deliberately classifies unsupported
inputs as `BLOCKED_WITH_NEXT_ACTION`; this is not backlog completion.

## Processing an existing issue

Run **Autonomous issue processing** manually and supply the issue number. This is required for issues that predate the workflow, including issue #76.

## Evidence location

Each processing run writes:

```text
evidence/issues/<number>/
├── REQUEST.json
├── REQUEST.sha256
├── CONTEXT.md
├── ANSWER.md
└── STATUS.json
```

The generated branch and PR are work products, not evidence of correctness by themselves.
