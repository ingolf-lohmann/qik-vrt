# Finite weighted connectability scores (MAT-001 / MAT-002)

This file proves the discrete, kernel-checkable form of the manuscript's
weighted finite-horizon score result. Weights are natural numbers, hence
nonnegative by construction. A normalized score is represented by its
accepted-weight numerator together with the common total-weight denominator.
For two scores with the same strictly positive denominator, comparison of the
normalized ratios is exactly comparison of their numerators; no division or
floating-point arithmetic enters the kernel theorem.

## Truth boundary

The result applies to an explicitly finite, duplicate-free trace universe,
decidable acceptance predicates, natural-number weights, and a shared
strictly positive normalizer. Rational weights with a common denominator can
be scaled into this representation. This module does not prove an arbitrary
real-weight theorem, an empirical persistence advantage, or an identity with
biological fitness.

Order of normalized scores when the denominator is common and positive. This
is equivalent to comparing `small.acceptedWeight / D` and
`large.acceptedWeight / D` for the shared `D > 0`, without defining division
inside the checked model.

MAT-002: if a trace in the finite universe lies in `large \ small` and has
positive weight, inclusion upgrades score monotonicity to strict increase.
The split equation is constructive evidence that the witness is in the
finite universe. `traceUniverse.nodup` ensures set-like, non-duplicated counting.
