# Operational continuation through viable connections (FIT-001)

This module gives a deliberately scoped computer-science interpretation of
the phrase "survival of the fittest": operational continuation for a bounded
horizon requires a chain of viable successor connections.

## Truth boundary

Darwinian fitness in evolutionary biology remains relative reproductive
success in a specified population and environment.  This module neither
redefines that biological quantity nor proves that biological fitness is
identical to graph connectivity, software interoperability, or the number of
successors.

The checked result is about an abstract transition system only.  In that
model, "anschlussfaehig" means that a state is viable and has an admissible
transition to a viable successor.  The theorem establishes continuation under
those explicit definitions; application to a concrete computer, organism, or
environment requires a separately justified model correspondence.

An abstract representation of Darwinian fitness as relative reproductive

The score type is intentionally generic because the empirical definition and
normalization belong to the selected biological study.

`Survives system horizon current` means that `current` remains operationally
continuable for the requested finite horizon.

At horizon zero, current viability is sufficient.  At a successor horizon,
one viable connection and survival of its successor for the remaining horizon
are necessary and sufficient.

FIT-001: kernel-checkable operational continuation theorem.

The theorem justifies "survival of the anschlussfaehigsten" only as the scoped
computer-system interpretation encoded by `ContinuationSystem` and `Survives`.
It does not change Darwin's biological meaning and makes no empirical claim.
