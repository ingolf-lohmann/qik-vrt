# EAP-LCTP -00 current-synthesis candidate

Status: **`LOCAL_CURRENT_CANDIDATE_NOT_SUBMITTED`**.

This directory is a new local candidate for the individual Internet-Draft
`draft-lohmann-qikvrt-local-change-time-00`.  It is a separate current
preparation for the QIK-VRT observer-relative local-change-time synthesis.  It
does **not** report an IETF Datatracker submission, acceptance, announcement,
endorsement, RFC, standard, working-group adoption, or independent
interoperability result.

## Historical preservation

The earlier directory `../ietf-temporal-provenance-00-candidate/` remains a
byte-preserved local candidate for a different, unpublished Internet-Draft
name.  It is neither edited nor reinterpreted as this candidate.  That
historical candidate used a local receipt sequence and the labels
`RETROGRADE_REFERENCE` and `FORWARD_REFERENCE`; this new -00 candidate uses a
distinct draft name and a distinct profile identifier.

## What is revised here

The profile evidence object has version `eap-lctp-1`.  It represents the
receiver-local effective-change order as `local_change_index`.  In QIK-VRT
terminology this is the receiver's **operational Eigenzeit**: a strictly
increasing local change order.  It is not a global clock and is not, by
itself, a claim about relativistic metric proper time.

For a validated comparison, the profile reports
`NEGATIVE_INFORMATION_DIRECTION` precisely when:

```
delta(local_change_index) > 0
delta(source_order_marker) < 0
```

and the receiver identity, designated baseline, authenticated source and
receiver assertions, and source-order domain all remain comparable.  The
classification is an authenticated relation between local change order and
source order.  It is not evidence of backwards signalling, a message from the
future, changed past records, payload truth, sender intent, physical or ontic
retrocausality, or authorization of a downstream effect.

The profile also does not encode coordinate-time assignments between
spacelike-separated physical events.  A source observer's local-present event
can be assigned to another observer's coordinate future without becoming that
observer's causal future; no source-bound object is available before a
future-directed delivery path reaches the receiver.

## Local validation and fixity

```sh
python3 -B verify_candidate.py
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

The validator checks the XML header, seven deterministic classification
fixtures, the declared local non-effect state, the manifest-to-file bindings,
the retained TXT/HTML structure, and the complete `SHA256SUMS` scope.  It does
not render, submit, send email, or authenticate a real principal.

The source was rendered twice with the repository-locked `xml2rfc 3.34.0`
environment on Python 3.12.13 using `--no-network` and independent isolated
caches.  Both runs produced byte-identical TXT and HTML outputs.  The renderer
completed without warnings or errors.  The retained text has a maximum line
length of 72 characters and contains the rendered IETF Trust boilerplate,
Security Considerations, and IANA Considerations.  `idnits` is not a declared
runtime component, so no `idnits` result is claimed.

Before any external upload, the final bytes, account fields, and destination
must be observed again, and the author must confirm the exact artifact set at
action time.

No command in this directory submits a document, sends email, calls the
Datatracker, creates a repository reference, or mutates an external system.
