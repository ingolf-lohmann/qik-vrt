# QIK-VRT Open Multi-Node Architecture 4AV1

4AV1 removes the fixed additional-node count from 4AV. The Seed keeps an open node registry. Future Nodes are added by appending authorized request rows under `registry/node_request_queue/*.tsv` or `registry/KNOWN_NODE_REQUESTS.tsv`.

This preserves the QIK-VRT boundary: no global scanning, no self-propagation, no foreign repository write. The Seed revalidates only known or explicitly queued Nodes.
