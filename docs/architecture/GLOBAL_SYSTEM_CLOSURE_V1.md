# QIK-VRT Global System Closure v1

## Bounded closure contract

QIK-VRT is externally treatable as one closed repository process only when
every interaction advances the same canonical chain and produces one
checkable successor state:

`INTERACTION -> EVIDENCE -> WORK_UNIT -> CANDIDATE -> GATES -> EFFECT_ACK -> EFFECT -> RECEIPT -> OBSERVATION`

“One system” means one entrypoint, one ordered productive chain, one selected
next effect per scope, and hash-linked receipts. It does not require a
single-file implementation. Internal implementations remain replaceable
capabilities.

This contract is a repository-control specification. It is not a theorem that
every historical or physical claim is true, and it does not expand the finite
`qikvrt-global-claim-scope-v1` completion receipt.

## Monotone, measured advancement

A candidate advances this closure scope only when:

1. at least one declared integer gate metric increases and none decreases; or
2. the canonical metric map is byte-stable and the transition is recorded as
   `BYTE_STABLE_NO_OP`.

A regression is rejected rather than made canonical. Metrics establish only
their declared bounded comparison; they do not prove hidden quality,
completeness, safety, consensus, or eventual termination.

## Persistence and recovery

Each transition is a small, content-addressed checkpoint that binds its
predecessor:

1. `CONTRACT_BOUND`
2. `ANTICIPATION_MATERIALIZED`
3. `EFFECT_INTENTS_GATED`
4. `CANDIDATE_VERIFIED`
5. `AUTHORITY_OBSERVED`
6. `MIRROR_OBSERVED`
7. `RECEIPT_CLOSED`

Before an external mutation, a local candidate may be abandoned or reverted.
After a possibly executed remote mutation, the system must not claim rollback.
It observes the external state read-only and continues through idempotent replay
or forward repair.

## Effect boundary

The existing five-state EFFECT_ACK implementation remains the only ordinary
release gate. Observation and anticipation may produce evidence, projections,
work units, and inert effect intents; they cannot manufacture
`EFFECT_ACK_DONE`.

Every external effect still requires fresh effect-specific evaluation,
provenance and responsibility binding, the applicable gates, explicit human
authorization, and a subsequent effect receipt. A due time, workflow success,
transport acknowledgement, or local zero exit code is not effect permission.

Target/time/payload envelope validation is deliberately separable from this
core. A concrete target, dispatch record, or publication queue is not part of
the closure-core projection.

## Current-main projection

`tools/qikvrt_anticipation.py` consumes an input bound to the current Authority
status files and a named Git tree. It deterministically materializes:

- `anticipation/current.json`
- `anticipation/history.jsonl`
- `anticipation/trends.json`
- `anticipation/derivatives.json`
- `anticipation/next-effect.json`
- `receipts/anticipation/0001-contract-bound.json`
- `receipts/anticipation/0002-anticipation-materialized.json`

The projection is scope-qualified and remains
`EFFECT_ACK_CONTINUE`. It does not dispatch, merge, synchronize repositories,
publish to Zenodo, or infer repository-wide completion. The next effect is a
proposal for the earliest safe incomplete persistence stage.

## Supersession boundary

The concrete PR-202 evidence, historical PR-203 trees, old live target
envelope, old target evaluation, old Zenodo queue, and their receipts remain
historical evidence only. Their hashes and remote gates do not transfer to this
current-main candidate.
