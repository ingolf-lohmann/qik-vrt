# Current authority map

QIK-VRT contains an active reference implementation and a substantial
historical research and delivery archive. This map identifies the shortest
path to the current operational authority.

## Active runtime

- `src/qikvrt_effect_ack.py` — five-state synchronous reference gate
- `src/qikvrt_api_handler.py` — authenticated ingest, verification, staging,
  status, transaction, provenance, and audit behavior
- `src/qikvrt_github_api_shim.py` — repository-scoped local HTTP adapter
- `scripts/qikvrt_api_client.py` — validating client
- `qikvrt.py` — authorization-before-effect launcher and publication planner
- `tools/qikvrt_subprocess.py` — bounded subprocess supervision
- `tools/qikvrt_integrity.py` — canonical content-tree integrity tooling
- `src/effect_ack_core.c` and `include/qikvrt/effect_ack.h` — strict ANSI-C90
  five-state core
- `tools/qikvrt_adaptive_runtime.sh` and `runtime/` — bounded proposal-only
  collective adaptation and exact-key verified cache reuse
- `tools/qikvrt_zenodo_actions.py` — hash-bound DOI reserve/finalize client
- `api/qikvrt_github_api.openapi.yaml` — external API contract

## Verification authority

- `tests/` — twelve Python test modules, the offline renderer, and shell/C90
  verification contracts
- `Makefile` — complete local verification entry point
- `STATUS.md` — precise demonstrated and open boundaries
- `BUILD_SUMMARY.md` — test counts and verification results
- `docs/TEST_INVENTORY.md` — test-module inventory
- `REPOSITORY_FILE_MANIFEST.json`, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and
  `REPOSITORY_FILE_MANIFEST.json.sha256` — canonical integrity trio

## Concept and specification

- `README.md` — current technical entry point
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — runtime and deployment architecture
- `docs/BOUNDARIES.md` — operational boundaries
- `docs/QIKVRT_THREAT_MODEL.md` — threat model
- `docs/Die_Spirale_des_entscheidenden_Unterschieds.md` — full German-language
  synthesis, including the universal ontology of difference and the distinct
  proof and correspondence levels used by the work

## Release anchor

The current public release is the annotated tag
`v2026.07.22-effect-ack-universality-1.0.0` in both repositories. The working
paper is archived as `10.5281/zenodo.21498773`; the deterministic tagged source
export is archived as `10.5281/zenodo.21498774`. Exact repository-specific
commit, tree and tag-object identities are retained on the public
`qikvrt/zenodo-state` evidence branch.

Historical files remain evidence of their own time and content. They do not
override a current failure or expand the supported runtime scope.
