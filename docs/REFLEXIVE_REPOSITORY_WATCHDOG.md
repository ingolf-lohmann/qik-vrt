# Reflexive repository watchdog and pre-deadlock admission

The adaptive repository monitor is extended by a read-only watchdog that observes its own repository instance every five minutes and at relevant workflow transitions. Its purpose is not to wait for a deadlock and then diagnose it. It models writer leases, runner pressure, exact-head execution evidence, and unchanged progress topology early enough to issue a deterministic `HOLD` before a second writer or replacement writer is admitted.

## Operational model

Each repository instance carries the same contract, controller, workflow, and regression test. The Authority remains the serialized source of the portable contract; Mirror and future mesh nodes must retain their own repository identity and integrity projections while satisfying the same structural acceptance.

The watchdog treats repository activity as a resource-allocation graph:

- `REPOSITORY_WRITE_LEASE` has capacity one;
- active repository writers hold or request that lease;
- queued productive workflows request platform runner capacity;
- a writer without a job/step transition beyond its lease is stale;
- unchanged active topology beyond the progress lease is an early stall signal;
- `action_required` and zero-job runs are untrusted execution gaps;
- no active runner is not interpreted as `PIPELINE_EMPTY`.

The first deterministic response is admission control, not destructive recovery: keep one expected-head-bound writer, coalesce only superseded observer runs, preserve an exact-head receipt, and stop before another writer is introduced. The watchdog never cancels a productive writer, mutates a ref, merges a pull request, or performs a release, deployment, Zenodo, DOI, or IETF effect.

## Reflexivity

The watchdog observes the workflows that create and verify repository state, while its own executions are classified as observers rather than productive writers. Observer executions use a coalescing concurrency group so newer observations replace obsolete observations without consuming the repository write lease. A scheduled observation prevents unchanged heads from becoming permanently invisible merely because no new event occurs.

## Database comparison boundary

Conventional relational database systems already provide transaction deadlock handling techniques such as prevention, detection, ordering, and timeout policies. The QIK-VRT improvement claimed here is narrower and architectural: deadlock-risk admission is bound to versioned repository heads, workflow/job evidence, provenance receipts, Authority-to-node serialization, and external-effect boundaries across independently instantiated repositories. It is not a claim that every relational database lacks deadlock management, nor a benchmark proving universal performance superiority.

## Nonclaims

A successful watchdog run is observation evidence, not gate success. The mechanism does not prove global deadlock freedom, repository completion, Authority–Mirror equality, empirical confirmation, scientific consensus, `PASS`, `FINAL_PASS`, or `EFFECT_ACK_DONE`.
