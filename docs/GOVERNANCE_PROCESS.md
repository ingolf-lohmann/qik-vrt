# Governance Process: Verfassung in Anwendung

This document operationalizes the constitution of traceability.

## GOV-STEP-001 Intake
A case begins only when a significant effect, assertion, decision, risk, or documented difference is stated.

Required intake fields:
- exact assertion
- affected person or system
- observation class
- evidence class
- potential consequence
- urgency
- responsible reviewer
- trace id

## GOV-STEP-002 Assertion class gate
Every assertion must be classified as one of:
- FACT
- OBSERVATION
- DOCUMENTATION
- TESTIMONY
- HYPOTHESIS
- SUSPICION
- RISK
- INTERPRETATION
- SPECULATION
- REFUTED

No assertion may move upward in certainty without new traceable evidence.

## GOV-STEP-003 Evidence and counter-evidence
Evidence is not only collected. It is classified, linked to origin, and checked against counter-evidence.

Minimum fields:
- source
- timestamp if available
- integrity status
- chain of custody if applicable
- relevance
- limitations
- counter-evidence checked

## GOV-STEP-004 Role assignment
Roles are assigned before consequence:
- affected party
- witness
- reviewer
- decision-maker
- technical operator
- institutional owner
- legal or domain expert if required
- public node only if public interest requires it

## GOV-STEP-005 Multicast delivery
Relevant information is multicast to the responsible recipient group, not broadcast without limit and not monopolized by a private unicast channel.

Required delivery properties:
- sender
- payload
- responsible recipient group
- delivery status
- feedback status
- trace status

## GOV-STEP-006 Privacy and proportionality
Traceability does not mean total exposure.

Required checks:
- purpose limitation
- data minimization
- proportionality
- reversible measure preferred
- protected review if public disclosure would cause harm

## GOV-STEP-007 Emergency handling
If danger is concrete and plausible, protective action may precede final proof.
Emergency action must remain documented, proportionate, reviewable, and non-punitive until proof is established.

## GOV-STEP-008 Correction and nonregression
Errors must be corrected. Clean distinctions must not be blurred later.

## GOV-STEP-009 Sanctions and misuse prevention
The process itself may not become a tool of surveillance, humiliation, harassment, or false accusation.
Deliberate falsification, trace destruction, and responsibility evasion are sanction-relevant.

## GOV-STEP-010 Revision
The governance model is versioned. Any change must be documented with rationale, affected requirements, and nonregression assessment.

## Final-pass rule
No final-pass status is allowed unless assertion class, evidence, role assignment, multicast delivery, privacy/proportionality, traceability, correction path, and nonregression gates are satisfied.
