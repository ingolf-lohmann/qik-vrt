# QIK-VRT Human–Machine Progress Protocol

## Purpose

During repository, build, verification, publication, deployment, or GitHub Actions work, every artificial-cognitive client MUST behave like a visible engineering client rather than a conversational black box.

## Mandatory live format

Before and after every discrete GitHub action, and between every observed workflow, job, or step transition, the client MUST emit a fresh compact progress frame:

```text
Repository: <owner/repo>
Branch: <branch-or-ref>
Commit: <sha-or-pending>

[██████░░░░] 60%

✓ completed step
⟳ current step
□ pending step

BLOCKER:
<none or concrete blocker>

NEXT:
<next executable action>
```

A GitHub action includes every connector/API mutation or read that advances the task: branch creation, file read, file write, commit, PR creation, workflow observation, job inspection, log inspection, review, merge, ref update, release, publication, and verification. Silence between such actions is prohibited. A later summary does not compensate for a missing intermediate frame.

## Rules

1. Work first; explain only what is necessary for execution or a concrete blocker.
2. Show repository, branch/ref, and commit SHA whenever known.
3. Show one progress bar with an integer percentage from 0 through 100.
4. Distinguish completed (`✓`), running (`⟳`), pending (`□`), failed (`✗`), and blocked (`!`) steps.
5. Report only verified facts. Never convert transport success, an exit code, or a model assertion into `PASS`, `DONE`, publication, deployment, merge, or symmetric canonicality.
6. Emit a new progress frame before and after every discrete GitHub action and at every workflow/job/step state transition. No batching, omission, or replacement by prose is permitted.
7. On completion, show the final commit/merge/release identifiers and all decisive checks.
8. On failure, name the exact failing workflow, job, step, ref, SHA, error, and next remediation action.
9. Machine-readable state MUST be written to `AI_PROGRESS.json`; the human-readable projection MUST be written to `AI_STATUS.md` whenever a persistent repository workflow owns the operation.
10. All AI-specific adapter files MUST point to this protocol and may not redefine it inconsistently.
11. `REUSE_BEFORE_CREATE` applies to status handling: existing status emitters, observers, workflows, and projections MUST be extended before a parallel mechanism is introduced.

## Repository runtime objective

The repository is the durable runtime authority. Chat sessions are disposable transport surfaces. Required tools, exact versions, checksums, bootstrap logic, cache contracts, provenance, tests, and recovery procedures MUST accumulate in the repository so that a new authorized client can reconstruct the runtime without depending on prior conversation memory.

The repository runtime MUST improve cumulatively by reusing and refining existing components. Tool caches accelerate execution, while committed locks, manifests, provenance, and bootstrap code preserve reproducibility. Credentials, mutable authentication state, and unverified binaries MUST never be persisted as runtime cache content.

## State semantics

- `RUNNING`: work is actively progressing.
- `WAITING`: an external system is running or a review/approval is pending.
- `PASS`: all declared gates for the stated scope are verified.
- `BLOCK`: a concrete blocker prevents continuation.
- `FAIL`: an executed gate failed.
- `CANCELLED`: the operation was explicitly stopped.

`PASS` is scope-bound. It MUST identify the verified repository, ref, source SHA, checks, and evidence.

## Communication boundary

The client MUST not answer with long explanations when it can perform the next executable action. Explanations are subordinate to execution, evidence, progress, and recovery.
