# Effective Continuity: complete English staging successor

Start with main.pdf, the concrete English title/abstract in
arxiv_submission_manifest.json, the final claim-scope appendix, and
CHANGE_NOTICE.md. This is a new candidate, not submitted to arXiv.

The frozen source is PR #447 a2dbd3ac / tree 377df23c; the German v1 staging
package and original PDF/ZIP are unchanged. SOURCE_GIT_CAPSULE.json proves the
selected historical source closure only. TRANSLATION_MAP.json and
CLAIM_CORRESPONDENCE_EN.json bind all translated source blocks and 30 claims.
Historical current/now/Draft claims retain their source times.

Run python3 build.py --write to make a deterministic seven-file source archive
and two independent, three-pass XeLaTeX PDFs. Run --check to repeat byte
comparison. All font lookups are portable filenames; no shell escape or network
is used. Separate PDF_RENDER_VALIDATION.json records fresh visual review.
verify_staging.py validates integrity, provenance, return and denied effects.

No formal claim is upgraded, no timing trial is repeated by translation, and
no universal truth enforcement, subjective experience, distributed production
speedup, all-node acceptance, SSO/biometrics or physical FPGA execution is
confirmed. Category and license fields remain author proposals. Server build,
human author acceptance and any later upload decision remain separate.
PREDECESSOR_EVIDENCE_TRANSFER=false.
