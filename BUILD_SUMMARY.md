# Local verification and publication-readiness summary

**Snapshot date:** 2026-07-22

**Release identity:** annotated tag
`v2026.07.22-effect-ack-universality-1.0.0` in both repositories; working-paper
DOI `10.5281/zenodo.21498773`; software DOI `10.5281/zenodo.21498774`.

**Verified object:** the identical tagged content tree in both repositories;
repository-specific commit and annotated-tag object identities are retained in
the public finalization evidence branch.

The reproducible Python test command is:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 \
  python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

The discovery pattern matches thirteen Python files. Twelve contain the
following 128 test cases; `tests/test_ietf_offline_render.py` is a command-line verifier
exercised separately with the locked renderer:

| Module | Tests |
|---|---:|
| API client | 4 |
| five-state effect protocol and conformance | 41 |
| handler security | 17 |
| handler unit behavior | 6 |
| repository-integrity generator | 1 |
| launcher and publication planner | 15 |
| license transition and exact official text | 5 |
| seed/import workflows | 12 |
| TCP/IP end-to-end adapter | 1 |
| release-workflow structure | 6 |
| Zenodo reserve/finalize client | 17 |
| deterministic Zenodo manifest builder | 2 |

The strict ANSI-C90 test independently compares the implementation with an
oracle across all 2,621,440 valid abstract snapshots. Including its additional
release and conjunct checks, it performs 7,864,387 checks and passes.

## Additional local evidence

- The bounded collective-adaptive runtime remains fail closed. It emits
  reviewable evidence and proposals in `EFFECT_ACK_CONTINUE`; it cannot approve,
  merge, tag, release, publish, write to a network, or mutate its own policy.
- Automatic runtime acceleration is limited to reuse of an exact-key verified
  cache. Performance observations may produce a reviewable proposal; they do
  not autonomously reorder work or skip a mandatory gate.
- The POSIX and Windows GitHub-CLI bootstrap, cache-manipulation, cleanup, and
  rollback contracts pass on their hosted runners. Exact renderer setup remains
  fail closed when CPython 3.12.13 is absent from a runner toolcache.
- The scientific finite-model proof passes with explicit limits: it does not
  prove a universal decoder, information recovery from non-injective
  observations, eventual DONE, or unconditional cyberphysical safety.
- The aggregate test gate regenerates the scientific proof report byte-for-byte,
  verifies the optimized-mode refusal, and requires complete SHA-256 coverage
  of the scientific bundle.
- Python 3.12.13 with `xml2rfc` 3.34.0 validates the Draft-01 XML and reproduces
  its clean TXT and HTML artifacts. No normative Draft-01 change is required.
- The adaptive-runtime CI contract executes that offline render comparison on
  Linux x64. macOS Intel and Windows x64 execute the GitHub-CLI and bootstrap
  contracts and automatically add the exact renderer comparison when their
  `setup-python` toolcache supplies CPython 3.12.13; no fallback interpreter is
  accepted as the canonical renderer.
- The associated scientific PDF has six A4 pages and passed local render and
  visual inspection.

The canonical integrity files are current for this snapshot, and the final
aggregate `make test` passes against them. Authorization behavior is covered by
local tests; this summary does not claim that a real externally authorized
publication master gate was run.

## External state

The two public repository heads carry the same release tree under the annotated
tag `v2026.07.22-effect-ack-universality-1.0.0`. Zenodo publishes the exact
working-paper files under DOI `10.5281/zenodo.21498773` and the deterministic
tag-tree source export under DOI `10.5281/zenodo.21498774`. The public
`qikvrt/zenodo-state` branch records exact commit, tree, tag-object, deposition
and file-hash evidence.

No GitHub Release object was created. No IETF Datatracker submission was
performed or requested; Draft-01 XML, TXT and HTML were preserved.

See `STATUS.md`, `EVIDENCE_BOUNDARY.md` in the scientific bundle, and
`HISTORICAL_ARTIFACT_BOUNDARIES.md` for the exact claim boundaries.
